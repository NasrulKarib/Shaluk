# Shaluk

## üìù Overview  
**Shaluk** is a web app designed for **CUET students** to order food and essential medicines from local shops. It eliminates the struggle of finding supplies after evening hours, ensuring a smooth browsing, searching, and ordering experience. The platform includes an **admin panel** to manage shops, products, and deliveries efficiently.

## üéØ Motivation  
Students at CUET often struggle to purchase food or medicine in the evening due to:

- **Lack of nearby shops** ‚Äì Most essential stores are outside campus, making access difficult.
- **Dependence on friends** ‚Äì Students rely on others going outside for tuition to bring necessities.
- **Restricted movement for female students** ‚Äì The **women‚Äôs hall gate closes at 7 PM**, limiting their ability to buy essentials.
- **Urgent medical needs** ‚Äì Sometimes, students require immediate medicine but face accessibility issues.

**Shaluk** solves these problems by providing a **centralized ordering platform** where students can conveniently place orders, and admins ensure timely deliveries.
